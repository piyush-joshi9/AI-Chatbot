Implementation of Chatbot using NLP
This project demonstrates the development and implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversations, offering a seamless interaction experience. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to building a basic chatbot using Python, showcasing the potential of NLP in creating intelligent conversational agents.

Features
Intent Recognition: Identifies user intents through predefined patterns and NLP techniques.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Processes user input to extract meaningful context.
Rule-Based Responses: Implements a set of predefined rules to generate relevant replies.
Extensible Design: Offers flexibility to add new intents and responses for enhanced functionality.
Interactive User Experience: Ensures smooth communication with a focus on natural conversation flow.
Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For tokenization, stemming, and intent classification.
Scikit-learn: Used for training machine learning models (if applicable).
Flask (Optional): For hosting the chatbot as a web application.
Corpus Data: Used for training and intent classification.

How It Works
User Input: The user provides input in natural language.
Processing: The chatbot uses NLP techniques to process the input, tokenize it, and classify the intent.
Response Generation: Based on the identified intent, a predefined or generated response is delivered to the user.
Setup and Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Techsaksham/P4-Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the chatbot:
python chatbot.py
Potential Use Cases
Customer Support: Automating FAQs and customer interactions.
E-learning: Providing quick answers to student queries.
Personal Assistance: Assisting with reminders, queries, or scheduling.
Future Enhancements
Integrate machine learning models for dynamic intent classification.
Use advanced transformer models like BERT or GPT for more sophisticated responses.
Deploy the chatbot as a web or mobile application for enhanced accessibility.
